#Simple explanation of the code:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary libraries for working with Langchain, Streamlit, and environment variables:
Import the ChatOpenAI class from the langchain_openai module
Use case: To create and manage chat-based interactions with OpenAI models
Import the ChatPromptTemplate class from the langchain_core.prompts module
Use case: To define and structure prompts for chat interactions
Import the StrOutputParser class from the langchain_core.output_parsers module
Use case: To parse and handle string outputs from the chat interactions
Import the Streamlit library as st
Use case: To create interactive web applications for data visualization and user interfaces
Import the os module
Use case: To interact with the operating system, such as accessing environment variables
Import the load_dotenv function from the dotenv module
Use case: To load environment variables from a .env file into the application


Loading Environment Variables: It loads environment variables from a .env file using load_dotenv().
Setting Environment Variables: It sets two environment variables, LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 and LANGCHAIN_API_KEY, using values from the .env file.
Creating a Prompt Template: A prompt template is created with a system message and a user message placeholder for questions.
Setting Up Streamlit: Streamlit is used to create a simple web interface with a title and a text input field.
Configuring the Language Model: The code configures the Ollama language model (LLama2) and sets up an output parser.
Creating a Chain: A chain is created by combining the prompt template, language model, and output parser.
Handling User Input: If the user enters text in the input field, the code processes the input through the chain and displays the result.
